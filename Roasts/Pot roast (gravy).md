## Notes

- I always make WAY TOO MUCH. This is a good workhorse recipe, cheap and filling.
- Amazing when done in a Dutch oven. But you'll need a big one The 2kg of chuck will already fill a standard sized one.
- this makes A LOT, good for 3 meals a day for days! You'll have to give it away.
- Technically also a stew once the meat is  shredded.
- Remove the meat and add veg, and it becomes [[Vegan Pot roast (gravy)]]
