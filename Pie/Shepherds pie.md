## Ingredients

For the mash potato:
1. 700g russet #potato 
2. 1/4 cup #half-and-half
3. 55g unsalted #butter
4. 3/4 teaspoon kosher #salt
5. 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black #pepper
6. 1 #egg yolk

 For the meat filling:
1. 2 tablespoons #canola_oil
2. 1 cup chopped #onion
3. 2 #carrot , peeled and diced small
4. 2 cloves #garlic, minced
5. 700g #lamb mince
6. 1 teaspoon kosher #salt
7. 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black #pepper
8. 2 tablespoons all-purpose #flour
9. 2 teaspoons #tomato_paste
10. 1 cup #chicken_stock
11. 1 teaspoon #worcestershire_sauce
12. 2 teaspoons freshly chopped #rosemary leaves
13. 1 teaspoon freshly chopped #thyme leaves
14. 1/2 cup fresh or frozen #corn kernels
15. 1/2 cup fresh or frozen English #peas

### Recipe

1. Peel the #potato and cut into 1.2cm dice. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Place the #half-and-half and #butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds. Drain the #potato in a colander and then return to the saucepan. Mash the #potato and then add the #half-and-half, #butter, #salt and #pepper and continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the #egg yolk until well combined.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
3. While the #potato  are cooking, prepare the filling. Place the #canola_oil  into a 12-inch sauté pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the #onion and #carrot  and sauté just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Add the #garlic and stir to combine. Add the #lamb mince , #salt and #pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the #flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. Add the #tomato_paste, #chicken_stock , #worcestershire_sauce , #rosemary, #thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.
4. Add the #corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed #potato , starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the #potato  begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.
