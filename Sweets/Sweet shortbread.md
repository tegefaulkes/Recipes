#sweet_tooth #baked
## Ingredients

1. 450g (2 cups) #butter
2. 120g (1 cup) #icing_sugar
3. 500g (4 cups) #flour
4. 2 tablespoons #cornstarch

## Recipe

Work the #butter until very soft, add the #icing_sugar and work until well blended. You want this to be a smooth paste essentially.

Add #cornstarch and then #flour one cup at a time. Blend the first two cups with a spoon, the last two should be kneaded in with your hands. The secret is to have a smooth dough that you can smooth out by brushing your fingers over it.

If necessary, work the dough with your hands on the counter until you reach the point where you can smooth out imperfections with your fingers.

Pat dough to a 1.3cm thick round and use cookie cutters to shape. We typically use sprinkles or candied fruit (cherries are our favorite) to decorate these cookies.

Bake at 175C on convection for 7 minutes. Until the edges are just beginning to brown. If you over bake them, they will be dry and not as buttery/melt in your mouth.

If you make them, let me know how they turned out! Happy baking!

## Notes:

* Very sweet and lightly baked. It's fine, but I'd prefer a more savory recipe.
